# W1AW/0 Scheduler

In May 24-30, 2023, the Colorado section of the ARRL is going to be operating as W1AW/0 as part of
the Volunteers On The Air event! We need a way of scheduling operators to cover shifts.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will
automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
