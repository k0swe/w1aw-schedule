# W1AW/0 Scheduler

In May 24-30, 2023, the Colorado section of the ARRL is going to be operating as W1AW/0 as part of
the Volunteers On The Air event! We need a way of scheduling operators to cover shifts, and find the
[suggested tool](https://ok.arrl.org/w1awco/) to be a bit lackluster.

## Getting started with development

This project uses the [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) framework on top of [React](https://reactjs.org/).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
